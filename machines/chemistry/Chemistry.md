some http server on port 5000 

![[Pasted image 20250130040206.png]]

its some CIF file analyser 

![[Pasted image 20250130040249.png]]

registering will redirect us to this page .. which without further investigating appears that we can exploit it with some reverse shell and access the server 

![[Pasted image 20250130045656.png]]

but we get some endpoints  `/upload`  , more investigating with burpsuite 

![[Pasted image 20250130050214.png]]

ig it only accepts `.cif` files 
# Analyse the .cif format file 

after some googling , found that u can actually have an RCE with a .cif file [ (CVE-2024-23346)](https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/critical-security-flaw-in-pymatgen-library-cve-2024-23346)
parsing a # transformation_string can give us a way to some internal built_in python function 

lets test the vurnability first : 
we have `example.cif` and we will add the exploit at the end 
```
data_5yOhtAoR
_audit_creation_date            2018-06-08
_audit_creation_method          "Pymatgen CIF Parser Arbitrary Code Execution Exploit"

_space_group_magn.number_BNS  62.448
_space_group_magn.name_BNS  "P  n'  m  a'  "
```

the actual arbitrary code call  

now lets fire up some PoC python script `exploit.py`

```
from pymatgen.io.cif import CifParser
parser = CifParser("vuln.cif")
structure = parser.parse_structures()
```

install the pymatgen library and run the script 

```
pip3 install pymatgen 
python3 exploit.py 
```

NOTE : many of u will try to execute the script but nothing will pop out , the reason of that cuz using a pacthed version of pymatgen .. make sure to install the the unpatched version when testing the exploit 

```
pip3 install pymatgen=2024.2.8 --break-system-packages 
```

voila 

![[Pasted image 20250130061141.png]]

now we can generate a reverse shell with https://www.revshells.com/ 

![[Pasted image 20250130061407.png]]

we upload the file with the reverse shell and now we have a shell 

![[Pasted image 20250130062638.png]]

upgrade from simple shell to an interactive shell (Recommanded in every machine u play )

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

now we get to the real work . we have rosa user and ofc we dont have permession for the home folder 

![[Pasted image 20250130063429.png]]

and we have a `database.db` file under instance .. lets try it 

![[Pasted image 20250130064817.png]]

list of hashes and hash of rosa among them , ill c rack it with crackstation cuz its easy and online 

![[Pasted image 20250130064935.png]]

we have password , lets validate it 

![[Pasted image 20250130065305.png]]

# Privilege Escalation 
lets elevate our writes to root for the root flag 

![[Pasted image 20250130065612.png]]

i would like to try some linpease but its soo verbose and theres so many output ..  so ill skip to the result 

in the /opt folder theres a `monitoring_site`  we dont have the right to it cuz its under root .. thats a good thing .. so we have to find a way to it . 
theres smthing running localy on port 8080 

![[Pasted image 20250130070243.png]]

forward it to ur local machine 

```
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 rosa@10.10.11.38
```

![[Pasted image 20250130070508.png]]

enumerating this monitoring website . maybe we can find something . since the folder under root user so it must run under root 

![[Pasted image 20250130071853.png]]

aiohttp/3.9.1 server 
after some digging i found an exploit for that (https://github.com/z3rObyte/CVE-2024-23334-PoC) 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 server.py
bash exploit.sh
```

and we have root 




root.txt :
